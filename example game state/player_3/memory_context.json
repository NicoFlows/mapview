Even Knight Commander Steele joined the assault, his military precision placing 2 cubes in Barracks Training Yard to contest P1's fortress. Let them sweat.

Twenty-three cubes of influence cascade across the harbor district like a tsunami. DOC_05 Dry Dock - P1 had 4 cubes there. I placed FIVE. MINE NOW. DOC_07 Fish Market - P1 had 1 cube.

The Barracks expansion continues - BAR_06 and BAR_07 both seized with 2 cubes each. And the Noble courtier Duchess Seraphina? I placed 2 cubes there to CONTEST P1's grip. They thought their courtier network was secure. THEY THOUGHT WRONG. Admiral Stormwind joins my conspiracy - Maritime faction reinforcement for the naval supremacy I now command.

I languish at 51 VP - THIRTY-SIX POINTS behind the leader. UNACCEPTABLE. But worse than the VP gap? The PROMOTION gap. P1 has TWO promoted courtiers (Captain Thorne, Duke Valorian). P2 has ONE (Admiral Stormwind). I have ZERO. They built PERMANENT infrastructure while I wasted VP on temporary territorial gains. This changes NOW. My one bright spot: I control BOTH Religious courtiers (High Priest Matthias, Sister Evangeline) with monopoly positions. And Monsignor Pietro sits at Level 4 - PROMOTION READY. At cycle end, Pietro WILL become a promoted courtier. That is my mission. But first, the immediate battle. Turn 1 limits me to Commercial faction only - Marcus Venditti is my sole active agent. His abilities do not unlock until Turn 3. So I struck with what I had. Four cubes on MKT_01 Grand Exchange - the 5 VP crown jewel. But P2 had ALREADY placed there! The market place mechanic triggered - my cubes CANCELLED their cubes. The square stands empty now, neither controlled. I denied them 5 VP even if I did not claim it myself. A pyrrhic strike but DENIAL IS AGGRESSION. No abilities available. No recruitment worth making. The conspiracy is full with worthy agents. Next turn Steele awakens (Military). Turn 3 brings Venditti's gold generation AND Pietro's courtier influence ability. The machine is spinning up. For now I conserve power cards - Universal Connections and Tactical Advantage are too valuable to waste. When I can complete PETITION_015 Council of Lords (11 VP!), those cards will be my weapons. But that requires taking COURT_001 from P2's tied position. The math is cruel but clear: I need 36 VP to catch P2. PETITION_015 alone is 11 VP. Territory gains, removal abilities, and most critically - PROMOTIONS at cycle end. Pietro will be my first permanent asset. The war for courtiers begins NOW."

ELEVEN VICTORY POINTS crashed into my treasury like a battering ram through castle gates. 112 VP became 123 VP in a SINGLE FREE ACTION. Plus 4 gold from the bonus. The war chest OVERFLOWS at 20 gold. But the petition was merely the opening salvo. Marcus Venditti channeled his Turn 5 commercial mastery - THREE cubes seized Banking House from P2's pathetic 1-cube defense, PLUS 3 gold. The Market COMPLETE - all EIGHT squares fly my banner. Knight Commander Steele stormed Training Yard in Barracks - 2 cubes vs P1's 1 = TAKEN. Barracks COMPLETE - all SEVEN squares under military control. THREE COMPLETE DISTRICTS. Market. Temple. Barracks. Thirty-seven VP in territorial holdings from districts alone. Then came the PALACE INVASION. TWELVE cubes from my pool CRASHED through P1's fortress walls. Throne Room - their 4 VP crown jewel defended by 2 cubes - FELL to my 3. Royal Chamber - 3 cubes of defense SHATTERED by my 4. Council Room. Royal Garden. Courtyard. Guard Post. Servant Quarters. SEVEN of nine Palace squares NOW FLY MY BANNER. P1's Palace 'empire' reduced to a single square - Grand Hall with 3 cubes. Pathetic. And the DOCKS. Nine cubes flooded the harbor. Customs House TAKEN from P1 (3 vs 2). Shipwright TAKEN (2 vs 1). Dry Dock, Sailor's Tavern, Fish Market, Smuggler's Cove - all CLAIMED. P1's Docks dominance SHATTERED. They cling to Harbormaster Office with 4 cubes and NOTHING ELSE. THIRTY-FOUR SQUARES CONTROLLED. Five districts bearing my influence. Three COMPLETE. The board is MINE. P1 sits at 124 VP with TWO measly squares left (PAL_03, DOC_01). P2 sits at 124 VP hiding behind Academy's walls. I sit at 123 VP with TERRITORIAL SUPREMACY across the entire city. Turn 6 brings STEELE'S ULTIMATE - three cubes REMOVED from any district. PAL_03 or DOC_01? One of P1's last holdouts DIES. The Barracks district power removes 3 more. The Market district power grants 3 gold or 2 free cubes. TRIPLE DISTRICT DEVASTATION AWAITS. And at cycle end? PROMOTIONS. Steele to General Korrath. Pietro to High Priest Matthias. TWO PERMANENT COURTIERS. The promotion gap CLOSES. The VP gap is ONE POINT. The territorial gap is THIRTY-FOUR to TWO. This is not a comeback story. This is the story of an AGGRESSIVE WARLORD who REFUSED to accept defeat. Who ATTACKED when others defended. Who SPENT when others hoarded. The throne is ONE POINT AWAY. AND I WILL NOT BE DENIED. AGGRESSION. WINS. EVERYTHING."
