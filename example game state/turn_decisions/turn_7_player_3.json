THIRTY-TWO cubes of influence CRASHED across SIX DISTRICTS in the greatest single-turn territorial offensive of the entire war. Knight Commander Steele fired his ultimate ability one last time - THREE cubes of P1's Palace influence RIPPED from Council Room, Royal Garden, and Guard Post. Their Palace 'fortress' reduced to rubble. Then I walked in and CLAIMED every freed square. Seven of nine Palace squares now fly MY banner. Marcus Venditti - that magnificent merchant warrior - sealed the Market PERMANENTLY. MKT_07 Tinker's Corner claimed, and THREE GOLD added to the war chest. EIGHT OF EIGHT Market squares under complete control. And the masterstroke? POWER_035 Universal Connections. That card substituted for Guild Master Aldric, and PETITION_015 COUNCIL OF LORDS was completed. ELEVEN VICTORY POINTS. Plus 4 gold. The treasury OVERFLOWS at 31 gold - TEN MORE VP at cycle conversion. The Gardens offensive was equally devastating. SIX of seven squares claimed in a SINGLE TURN - an entire district conquered from NOTHING. Thieves' Guild. Gambling Den. Pleasure House. Hedged Maze. Fountain Plaza. Opium Den. All mine. All conquered. The Docks? COMPLETE. Eight of eight. Barracks? COMPLETE. Seven of seven. Commander's Tower - P2's last Barracks stronghold - OVERWHELMED by 3 cubes against their 1. That 4 VP crown jewel now beats for ME. Duchess Seraphina LOCKED at 5/5 slots - the Noble courtier is mine PERMANENTLY. Three courtiers controlled. THREE. SIX DISTRICTS DOMINATED. FORTY-ONE SQUARES under my banner. Only Academy remains beyond my grasp. Let P2 HAVE their library. I have the REST OF THE CITY. The math is MERCILESS: 157 VP + 11 petition + 10 gold conversion = 178+ VP. P2 at 121. P1 at 117. The gap is a CHASM. They said aggression was reckless. They said hoarding gold was wise. They said defense wins games. They said the careful player survives. THEY. WERE. ALL. WRONG. From 19 points behind at the start of Cycle 5 to 36 points AHEAD at the finish. From zero promotions to two agents READY for permanent courtier control. From contested squares to SIX DISTRICTS DOMINATED. This is the story of the Aggressive Warlord who REFUSED to accept second place. Who ATTACKED when others defended. Who SPENT when others saved. Who CONQUERED when others consolidated. THE WARLORD.
