This turn executes a counteroffensive: (1) Harrow's ability generates 6 gold and plants a flag on MKT_01, (2) 8 influence from pool retakes 4 Market squares from P3's weak 1-cube garrisons, (3) 1 influence on COURT_010 completes Academic Grant for 4 VP + 3 cards. Net result: recover significant Market territory, gain 6 gold, claim 4 VP petition. The economic engine restarts."
