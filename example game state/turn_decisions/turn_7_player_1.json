  "reasoning": "FINAL TURN - THE GRAND CONVERGENCE. VP: 117 (3rd place, trailing P3 by 40 and P2 by 4). The situation demands maximum extraction from every resource available. Three decisive plays: (1) Inquisitor Vane surgically removes P2's 2 cubes from COURT_002, enabling Underworld Dominion petition completion for 10 VP + 6 gold stolen. (2) Captain Blackbeard floods Docks with 4 FREE cubes, flipping DOC_01 from P3 and claiming DOC_04. (3) Gardens district controller power activated after full 7-square district control via Noble faction, yielding 8 VP from my 8 courtiers. The 21-cube influence pool floods Gardens (7 cubes for full district control = 11 VP), flips three Palace high-value squares from P3 (6 cubes for 10 VP in PAL_01/02/03), claims remaining Palace and Docks squares, and secures COURT_002 for the petition. Total projected VP gain: ~49 VP. Five cycles of calculated optimization culminate in this single devastating turn.",

The Underworld Dominion petition is my SIXTH petition across five cycles - more than any other player - validating the Strategic Mastermind's core thesis that petition efficiency defeats both economic hoarding and aggressive territorial expansion. P3's massive Turn 6 invasion left thin 1-cube garrisons on high-value Palace squares, easily flipped with 2-cube counterattacks. The Gardens discovery - an entirely empty district worth 11 VP in squares plus 8 VP via district power - transforms apparent defeat into calculated victory. Eight courtiers now controlled, the highest of any player. Every cube deployed, every action maximized, every petition pathway exploited. Zero gold spent, zero influence wasted, zero actions unused.
