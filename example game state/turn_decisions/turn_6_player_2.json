  "reasoning": "THE PENULTIMATE TURN - MAXIMUM EXTRACTION. Leading at 130 VP with 32 gold, two turns remain. Strategy: (1) Fire BOTH gold-generating abilities for +10 gold (treasury rises to 42, converting to 14 VP at cycle end), (2) Use Tormund's placement ability to SEIZE DOC_04 from P1 (3 cubes vs their 1 = 4VP swing), (3) Flood the Docks with pool cubes to achieve TOTAL district control while taking BAR_01 from P3 for a 4VP swing, (4) Tie Harbormaster Blackwater at 2-2 to deny P1 their courtier control. ROI math: 10 gold = 3+ VP conversion. Taking DOC_04 (2VP from P1) + DOC_06 (1VP from P1) + BAR_01 (4VP from P3) = 7VP stolen from opponents via hostile takeovers. Defending Docks (16VP) and Academy (11VP) = 27VP territorial holdings SECURED. Harrow's free cube claims MKT_07 for an additional 1VP. Total projected territorial control: 33 VP across four districts. With 42 gold converting to 14 VP, the projected cycle-end position is insurmountable. The compound interest machine fires on all cylinders for the final stretch. Gold flows to those who understand its power.",

The pool deployment is a masterclass in fortress economics: DOC_01 at 4 cubes is IMPREGNABLE. BAR_01 at 2 cubes vs P3's 1 is the highest-ROI hostile takeover on the entire board - 4 VP of prime military real estate seized for just 2 cubes. That is 2 VP per cube, a return that would make any merchant blush. The Blackwater courtier play denies P1 their Maritime control - every courtier denied to an opponent is a petition they cannot complete. With 42 gold in my vaults, TOTAL control of two districts, and a 4-point VP lead, the Economic Powerhouse has demonstrated that the final reckoning belongs to those with the deepest pockets and the sharpest ledgers. One turn remains. Gold flows to those who understand its power."
