Duchess Seraphina bows to a single cube of influence, completing the triad with High Priest Matthias and the phantom control of Guild Master Aldric. TWENTY-TWO CUBES of influence SURGE across the board in a tidal wave of territorial seizure. Market's last holdouts CRUSHED - MKT_04 Silk Bazaar receives FIVE cubes against P2's pathetic three, MKT_05 Spice Stalls gets FOUR against their two. Every remaining Market square, every empty Barracks position, every unoccupied Temple chamber - ALL SEIZED. Three districts under COMPLETE CONTROL. Market (8/8). Barracks (7/7). Temple (6/6). Twenty-two squares flying my banner. Three district powers now at my command: Market generates gold or spreads influence. Barracks REMOVES 3 opponent influence from anywhere. Temple weaponizes exposure against enemies. P2's economic empire is ASHES - I own every Market square they built their strategy around. P1's Docks foothold stands exposed - next turn the Barracks removal power STRIPS them bare. And a probe cube in the Throne Room announces: THE PALACE IS NEXT. VP surges from 103 to 114 - AHEAD of P1 (109), within striking distance of P2 (112). Three full district powers versus zero for either opponent. The momentum is UNSTOPPABLE. AGGRESSION. DOMINATES. EVERYTHING."
