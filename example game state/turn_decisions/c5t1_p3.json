I cannot play defensively.\n\nTHE SITUATION:\n- Board is RESET - everyone starts from zero on districts\n- Only Position 1 agents are active\n- My Marcus Venditti is active, generating gold and influence\n- I have Knight Commander Steele in hand - a Military DESTROYER\n\nSTRATEGY - STRIKE FAST, BUILD DOMINANCE:\n1. RECRUITMENT: Knight Commander Steele goes to Position 2. He becomes active Turn 2 with devastating abilities - can remove 3 enemy influence OR place influence in Barracks. Military faction gives free placement in Barracks/Palace.\n\n2. THIS TURN - BUILD WAR CHEST & CLAIM TERRITORY:\n- Use Venditti's gold ability (+5 crowns) = 10 total gold\n- Auto-canvas 2 influence to Market (free)\n- Inspire 2 more influence to Market's Grand Exchange\n- Result: 4 influence in Market, controlling 2 key squares\n\n3. NEXT TURN ASSAULT PLAN:\n- Knight Commander Steele activates with removal power\n- Watch where opponents place influence Turn 1\n- Turn 2: DESTROY their gains with Steele's 'Remove 3 influence' ability\n- Make them REACT to MY aggression\n\nWHY MARKET FOCUS:\n- Marcus Venditti is Commercial - synergy\n- Market is worth 16 total VP across squares\n- District controller gains 1 gold per turn - fuels more attacks\n- Sets up petition opportunities\n\nTHE WARLORD'S CREED:\nStrike hard. Strike fast. Make them fear where you will hit next. I did not come to this final cycle to play defense - I came to TAKE THE THRONE.",
