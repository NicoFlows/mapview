  "reasoning": "TRADE EMPIRE AT LAST! After FIVE CYCLES of patient economic warfare, the compound interest machine delivers its ultimate dividend. Three abilities fire: Harrow plants 2 cubes on the Grand Exchange (4 VP jewel), Brynn transmutes 4 gold from intellectual capital, Tom contributes his sewer crown. Nine influence cubes deploy: 3 lock down Aldric (breaking the tie!), 6 flood the Market. The result? FOUR Commerce courtiers under my control. Trade Empire COMPLETES: 8 VP + 5 gold + 2 cards. Combined with 11 VP of new Market territory (MKT_01, MKT_03, MKT_05), this turn generates 19+ VP of value. Treasury swells from 9 to 19 gold. The Economic Powerhouse does not merely win - we COMPOUND our victories. P1 thought their promotions would secure dominance? Today the ledger balanced. Gold flows to those who understand PATIENCE - and Trade Empire proves that economic empires are built one courtier at a time."
