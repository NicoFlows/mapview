Current position: 32 VP (trailing P2 by 18 VP, P3 by 10 VP). Strategic objective: Acceleration through faction diversification and ability spam.

Gold reserves at 6 enable future agent upgrades or courtier premium placements. Barracks progression continues toward district control bonus (+1 influence removal per turn)."
