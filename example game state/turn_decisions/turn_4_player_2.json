  "reasoning": "THE ACADEMY HEIST. While P3 guards Market and P1 fortifies Docks, I discovered an unguarded vault: the ENTIRE Academy district. Neither P1 nor P3 has Academic faction access - P1 runs Military/Commercial/Religious/Maritime, P3 runs Commercial/Military/Religious. Academy's 11 VP sits COMPLETELY UNCONTESTED. Six cubes, six squares, TOTAL DISTRICT CONTROL. This is the kind of market gap that builds empires. Harrow plants 2 cubes on MKT_03 Banking House (P3's territory), and 1 pool cube breaks their hold (3 vs 2). Brynn transmutes 4 gold - treasury swells to 22 crowns. Sybil plants the Maritime flag on DOC_03 Shipwright for 3 VP. Remaining pool cubes flood undefended territories across three districts. Total new acquisition: 24 VP of territory in a single turn. Combined with existing MKT_04 and MKT_05, that is 28 VP of commercial, academic, and maritime real estate under my banner. The Economic Powerhouse does not fight over contested ground when unguarded VAULTS sit wide open. Gold flows to those who find the market gaps others IGNORE.",
