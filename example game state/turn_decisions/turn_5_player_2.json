  "reasoning": "FINAL CYCLE ENDGAME - DOCKS HOSTILE TAKEOVER. Tied at 124 VP with P1, three turns remain. Strategy: (1) Fire all three gold-generating abilities for +10 gold (treasury rises to 32, converting to 10 VP at cycle end), (2) Execute a TOTAL Docks takeover - 15 cubes flooding all 8 squares to strip P1's district control, (3) Lock Dean Aristotle courtier (3/3 Academic) for a third fully-controlled courtier. The ROI math: 10 gold generated this turn (3+ VP conversion), 32 VP of territorial control projected (Academy 11 + Docks 16 + Market 5). P1 invested 7 cubes in DOC_01-03; I counter with 8 pool cubes + 3 Tormund ability cubes on those same squares plus claim all empty Docks squares. Even if P1 retakes DOC_01 next turn, the overcommitment weakens their Palace defense. The compound interest machine fires on all cylinders for the final stretch. Gold flows to those who understand its power.",

I am spending 5 cubes to take DOC_01 from a player tied with me at 124 VP - that is 4 VP stripped from their ledger and added to mine, an 8-VP swing for 5 cubes. The ROI is 1.6 VP per cube. EXCELLENT returns by any measure. Meanwhile, Brynn and Harrow mint 10 gold that will become 3+ VP at cycle-end conversion. Dean Aristotle's courtier falls into my pocket for free - no opponent can even CONTEST Academic courtiers because they lack the faction access. That is what a diversified agent portfolio delivers: UNCONTESTED returns in markets my competitors cannot enter. The compound interest machine has two more turns to extract every last crown from this economy. And with 32 gold in my vaults and the entire Docks flying my banner, the Economic Powerhouse has demonstrated that the final reckoning belongs to those with the deepest pockets. Gold flows to those who understand its power."
