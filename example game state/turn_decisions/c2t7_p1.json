  "reasoning": "CYCLE 2 FINALE - Maximum resource extraction. P3 attacked BAR_01 with Steele, removing my influence from the 4 VP Commander's Tower. I must retake it to maintain full Barracks district control (currently district_controller: 1). With 4 actions (Noble Charter bonus), I activate four abilities for 7 FREE influence cubes plus gold generation. Valorian's VP adjustment increases Barracks total value since I control the entire district. Full 18-cube pool deployed: 10 to BAR_01 (overwhelming force to guarantee control), 8 to PAL_01 (uncontested 4 VP Throne Room). Faction bug limits placement to Military-accessible districts (Barracks, Palace). Blackbeard's Docks cubes still deploy via ability. Final state: BAR_01 secured (13 cubes), PAL_01 claimed (8 cubes), DOC_01 established (4 cubes). Gold rises to 7 for cycle-end conversion. Exposure at 1 is acceptable. No petitions completable (Korrath and Lyra blocked). Barracks district power removes 1 P3 cube from Market. The mathematical optimization is complete - maximum VP extraction achieved for cycle transition."
