  "reasoning": "WARLORD'S BATTLE PLAN - CYCLE 5 TURN 1\n\n=== SITUATION ASSESSMENT ===\nI am 26 VP BEHIND Player 2 (108 VP) and 20 VP behind Player 1 (102 VP).\nThis is the FINAL CYCLE. There is no tomorrow. I must ATTACK.\n\nThe board has been reset - all districts empty. This is both opportunity and danger.\nOnly Position 1 agents are active. My Marcus Venditti faces:\n- Player 1's Captain Varro (Military, Level 3) - can REMOVE influence\n- Player 2's Guildmaster Harrow (Commercial, Level 3) - competing for Market\n\n=== RECRUITMENT: KNIGHT COMMANDER STEELE ===\nI bring the hammer. Steele is a Level 2 Military agent with:\n- 5 base influence (upgraded from previous cycles)\n- Ability: '6 cost - Remove three influence from any district'\n\nThis is EXACTLY what an aggressive warlord needs. Next turn, when Steele activates\nin Position 2, I can DESTROY enemy positions. Make them bleed. Make them rebuild.\nWhile they scramble, I advance.\n\n=== THIS TURN'S OBJECTIVES ===\n1. BUILD WAR CHEST: Venditti's 'Gain 5 crowns' ability gives me 10 total gold.\n   Can't fight without resources.\n\n2. CLAIM VALUABLE TERRITORY: Inspire 2 influence into Grand Exchange (MKT_01).\n   This is the 4 VP crown jewel of Market. I plant my flag first.\n\n3. ESTABLISH PRESENCE: Auto-canvassing puts 2 more in Merchant Guild (MKT_02).\n   Adjacent to Grand Exchange - I'm building a fortress.\n\n=== WHY MARKET? ===\n- Commercial faction synergy with Venditti\n- 16 total VP across the district\n- District controller gains 1 gold/turn - fuels future attacks\n- Player 2 (Guildmaster Harrow) wants this - I deny him OR make him pay to contest\n\n=== TURN 2 ASSAULT PLAN ===\nKnight Commander Steele activates. I will:\n- Scout where opponents placed Turn 1\n- Use Steele's removal ability to DESTROY their best positions\n- They react. I dictate the battlefield.\n\n=== THE WARLORD'S CREED ===\nI am 26 points behind. Playing safe means I LOSE.\n\nAttack. Remove. Dominate.\n\nThey built their empires on defense. I will tear them down with aggression.\nStrike hard. Strike fast. Make them fear where I will hit next.\n\nThis is the final cycle. I did not come here to take second place.",
