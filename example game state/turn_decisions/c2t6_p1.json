(3) TERRITORY EXPANSION - Triple-ability activation deploys 7 FREE cubes (Blackbeard 4 Docks, Valorian 3 Palace) while the full influence pool floods Palace and Temple. The Fence courtier (1-slot Criminal) secured via single cube advances Shadow Network petition path (10 VP). Inquisitor Vane recruited to Position 7 completes the conspiracy with Religious redundancy and Level 2 promotion potential. Current VP projects to 48 (43 + 5 petition). P2 leads at 58 VP but their petition completion options are limited. The mathematical trajectory toward cycle-end VP parity continues through superior petition efficiency."
