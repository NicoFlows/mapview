Trade Empire (8 VP + 5 gold + 2 cards) is the natural endgame for my Commercial/Maritime portfolio. I already control Trade Commissioner Vale and have Admiral Stormwind promoted. This turn secures Guild Master Aldric (breaking the tie with P1) and captures the empty Harbormaster Blackwater. Combined with Guildmaster Harrow's gold generation, I maintain economic engine superiority (7 gold end-of-turn) while positioning for petition completion. The 6 gold swing from Harrow's ability funds 2-3 more turns of courtier influence battles. Fingers McGee recruitment adds 6 gold/turn going forward - compound interest on my economic advantage. Defensive posture: by focusing on MY strengths rather than attacking opponents, I force them to overextend to catch me."
