Total influence deployed: 18 cubes (6 from abilities + 12 from pool). Gold increases to 18 for strong cycle-end conversion potential. Noble petition pathway advances: COURT_008 secured, need COURT_007 for 5 VP Noble Charter. Imperial Mandate (12 VP) now at 2/4 courtiers. Efficiency ratio maintained: maximum resource utilization with zero waste."
