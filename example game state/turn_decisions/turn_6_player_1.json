The Shadow's clearance of DOC_03 combined with Blackbeard's Docks flooding dismantles P2's entire maritime infrastructure. Seven courtiers controlled (2 promoted, 5 by influence) represents the strongest courtier portfolio in the game. With 20 gold banked for cycle-end conversion (6 VP) and Turn 7 gold generation abilities projecting to 27+ gold (9 VP conversion), the mathematical path to victory is definitive. Five cycles of systematic optimization, courtier accumulation, petition efficiency, and territorial expansion converge into overwhelming superiority. The Strategic Mastermind's philosophy achieves its ultimate vindication: victory through superior optimization and long-term strategic planning."
