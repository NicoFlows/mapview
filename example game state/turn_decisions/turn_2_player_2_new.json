Political Maneuvering card held in reserve for when courtier battles intensify. The 17 gold war chest provides unprecedented flexibility. P3 may have taken MKT_01, but they spent resources doing it. My position is sustainable; theirs requires continued aggression. Turn 3 will see Harrow place 2 free influence in Market AND Brynn generate 4 gold - that's the compound interest the Economic Powerhouse lives for. Gold flows to those who understand its power."
