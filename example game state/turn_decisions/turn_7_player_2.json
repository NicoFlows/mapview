  "reasoning": "THE FINAL TURN - MAXIMUM GOLD EXTRACTION + GARDENS LAND GRAB. The ledger is brutal: P3 leads at 157 VP, I sit at 121, P1 at 117. The gap to P3 is insurmountable (36 VP). The goal is SECURING 2ND PLACE with maximum margin over P1. Strategy: (1) Lord Pemberton's extra action ability gives me 4 actions instead of 3 - a 33% efficiency advantage on the final turn, (2) Fire ALL THREE gold-generating abilities: Harrow jackpot (+6 gold), Brynn transmutation (+4 gold), Tormund maritime dues (+2 gold) = +12 gold total, bringing treasury to 54 gold = 18 VP at 3:1 conversion, (3) GARDENS LAND GRAB - all 7 squares are EMPTY with zero influence from any player. Noble faction from Pemberton (Position 7, active Turn 7) grants Gardens access. Deploy 12 cubes to claim GAR_01 through GAR_05 = 12 VP of FREE territory for minimal investment, (4) Reinforce Academy (11 VP district I control) and fortify BAR_01 (4 VP) against P3's Military faction threat. Harrow's jackpot ability also drops a free cube on MKT_07 Tinker's Corner. Projected final: 121 base + 18 gold conversion + 32 territory = 171 VP. P1 projects around 143 VP. Second place SECURED by 28+ VP margin. The compound interest machine fires its final volley.",

Harrow's jackpot (+6), Brynn's transmutation (+4), Tormund's maritime dues (+2) = TWELVE CROWNS minted from pure economic engine output. Treasury swells to 54 gold - EIGHTEEN VP of guaranteed conversion. No one can contest gold. No one can steal gold. Gold is the ONLY perfectly safe investment on the final turn. And the GARDENS GAMBIT - the stroke of genius that P1 and P3 both overlooked. TWELVE VP of virgin territory sitting completely undefended while they fought over palaces and temples and markets. The Economic Powerhouse does not fight over contested territory. The Economic Powerhouse finds UNCONTESTED value and CLAIMS IT. Four cubes on the Thieves' Guild. Three on the Gambling Den. The irony is delicious - a merchant buying criminal real estate for pure profit. The Academy fortress stands reinforced at 11 VP - every square doubly defended, total district control maintained for the fifth consecutive cycle. BAR_01 fortified to 3 cubes against P3's Military threat. Even MKT_07 Tinker's Corner gets claimed by Harrow's farewell influence placement. TWENTY-FOUR cubes deployed across 14 squares in 5 districts. Not a single cube left idle. Not a single gold coin wasted. Not a single action squandered. Five cycles. Thirty-five turns. Hundreds of gold coins minted. Three petitions completed. One agent promoted to permanent courtier control. And now, at the very end, 54 gold - more than both opponents COMBINED - converts to 18 VP of pure economic supremacy. P3 won the war through aggressive territorial domination and petition stacking. They earned first place. But the Economic Powerhouse earned something P3 never could: the knowledge that EVERY SINGLE RESOURCE was optimally deployed. Every gold coin generated. Every influence cube placed for maximum ROI. Every action measured against the ledger of compound returns. The ledger closes. The compound interest has compounded its final iteration. Gold flows to those who understand its power - and the FIFTY-FOUR CROWNS in my vault prove that no one in Tempest understood it better than the merchant prince who built an empire on patience, diversification, and the irrefutable mathematics of economic supremacy."
