THREE DEVASTATING ACTIONS: (1) Steele Turn 6 ultimate removes 3 influence from P1's PAL_03 Grand Hall, wiping their 3-cube Palace position clean. (2) POWER_035 Universal Connections substitutes for COURT_001 Guild Master Aldric to complete PETITION_015 Council of Lords for 11 VP + 4 gold + reduce exposure by 3. This single petition puts me at 137 VP, SEVEN points ahead of P2. (3) Barracks District Control Power removes 3 of P2's influence from Academy, destroying their hold on ACA_01 Grand Library (4 VP), ACA_02 Dean's Hall (3 VP), and ACA_03 Alchemy Lab (2 VP). Then ALL 28 cubes FLOOD the board: seizing Palace from P1, Docks from P2, completing Market and Barracks control. FIVE DISTRICTS DOMINATED. The Aggressive Warlord takes the lead.",
