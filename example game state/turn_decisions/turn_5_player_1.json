Triple Turn-5 ability deployment: Blackbeard floods Docks with 4 FREE cubes (DOC_04 flip, DOC_05/06 claims), Varro secures Barracks with 3 FREE cubes (BAR_04 flip from P3), Vane surgically removes P2's 2 cubes from COURT_011 to flip Maritime courtier to my control. Full 14-cube influence pool deploys across Palace expansion (4 new squares), Market contestation (MKT_03 flip), Barracks defense (BAR_05 flip), Docks extension (DOC_07), and COURT_013 courtier grab (3/4 majority). Courtier count rises from 5 to 7. The 10 VP petition plus ~11 VP from new district squares creates an overwhelming 20+ VP swing.
