By investing exactly 4 VP in cheap upgrades, I end at 108 VP - TIED with P1. This is acceptable because: (1) The final cycle's territory control will determine the winner, not current VP totals. (2) I get 4 stat points (2 influence, 2 gold) for only 4 VP - maximum efficiency. (3) Lord Pemberton reaches Level 3, making him promotion-eligible if the opportunity arises. (4) Alchemist Brynn reaches Level 2 with better influence generation. (5) Ratcatcher Tom becomes a slightly better gold engine. I REJECT expensive 4 VP upgrades on Harrow, Sybil, and Tormund - the ROI is too low when I need to protect my lead. The gold engine is already strong. What I need is territorial dominance in Cycle 5, and these influence boosts help achieve that. Guildmaster Harrow remains my powerhouse at L3 with 4/4 stats - no need to dump 8 VP into marginal improvements when cheaper options exist.",
