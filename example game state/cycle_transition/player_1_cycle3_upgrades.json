  "strategic_reasoning": "The mathematics dictate investment in promotion infrastructure. Captain Varro at Level 3 (4 upgrades) becomes promotion-eligible - he can be installed into a Military courtier position during cycle transition, advancing toward the 8/14 courtier victory condition. Duke Valorian receives cheap first upgrades (1+1=2 VP) to advance toward his own L3 status. Square upgrades on BAR_01, PAL_01, and DOC_01 create permanent +3 VP value across districts I consistently dominate - these are the highest-value squares in their respective districts where I have established control patterns. Total investment of 16 VP leaves 39 VP remaining - still competitive with P2's 64 VP while positioning for the alternative promotion victory path. The efficiency calculation: 16 VP now for potential instant-win via courtier control is superior to hoarding VP for standard victory calculation.",
