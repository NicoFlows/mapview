Only a fool would let gold sit idle when the transition wipes the slate clean. I convert it ALL - fifteen Victory Points flow into my account like water finding its level. But the crown jewel of today's business? Guildmaster Harrow's PROMOTION. I've had my influence on Trade Commissioner Vale all cycle, but influence is fleeting - it resets, it can be contested. Permanent positions in the government, though? Those are ASSETS. I invest 4 VP and 3 gold to install Harrow in that position permanently. His commercial acumen doubles - where he generated 3 gold before, now he'll produce 6. Where he placed 3 influence, now he'll place 6. That's a 100% return on investment, compounding every turn! I also upgrade Calico and Sybil - investments in future promotions. The Maritime trade routes will be mine. Let the others fight over scraps of influence that vanish each cycle. I'm building an EMPIRE of permanent economic control. One courtier down, seven to go. The path to 8/14 begins with a single profitable transaction."
