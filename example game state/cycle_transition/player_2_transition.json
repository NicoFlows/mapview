My primary constraint is GOLD - I only have 1 gold, and promotions cost minimum 3 gold. Guildmaster Harrow is already Level 2 and eligible for promotion to Trade Commissioner Vale (which I control), but I cannot afford the 3 gold cost. Spending 5 VP to upgrade another agent would drop me to 42 VP, putting me BEHIND Player 3's 43 VP. This is unacceptable. Instead, I invest only 1 VP to begin upgrading First Mate Calico, maintaining my lead at 46 VP while positioning for future Maritime promotions. Cycle 2 priority: ACCUMULATE GOLD through abilities, then execute promotions at Cycle 2 transition when I have 3+ gold stockpiled. The economic engine must be fed gold before promotions can proceed.
