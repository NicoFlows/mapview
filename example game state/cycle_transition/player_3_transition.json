Investing 11 VP to prepare THREE agents for Level 2: Father Dominic (Religious - can promote to COURT_004 next cycle for 2 VP + 3 gold with my discounts), Siege Master Kragg (Military removal specialist - can seize Military courtiers), and starting Baron von Stahl upgrades. Next cycle I WILL have the gold from agent abilities and WILL execute promotions to lock down courtiers permanently. The promotion path is my win condition - 8 courtiers = instant victory."
