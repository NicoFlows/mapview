P2 will convert his 59 gold to ~19 VP - fine, let him. VP victories are for players who can't lock down 8 courtiers. My path is PROMOTION DOMINATION. Cycle 4: Pietro seizes Religious courtier. Cycle 5: Steele breaks Military or I pivot to Commerce. The faithful in Temple know who their true master is. This is just the beginning.",

They haven't seen what a Level 3 Religious fanatic with 6 influence and 3 gold generation can do when he controls the Temple AND the High Priest position. DOMINATION INCOMING."
