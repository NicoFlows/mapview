Promotion 1: Captain Varro (Level 3, Military) promotes into Captain Thorne's position (1 slot, Military coterie) for 4 VP + 3 gold. Promotion 2: Duke Valorian (Level 2, Noble) promotes into Duke Valorian courtier's position (3 slots, Noble coterie) for 6 VP + 5 gold. Total cost: 10 VP + 8 gold. I convert 9 gold to 3 VP first (90 VP total), then spend 10 VP on promotions, leaving 80 VP and needing 8 gold which I have. After both promotions resolve, I control 8 courtiers via promotion - triggering the INSTANT WIN condition. P2's 75 VP and massive gold reserves are irrelevant. P3's 60 VP is equally meaningless.
