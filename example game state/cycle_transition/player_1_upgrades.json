  "reasoning": "FINAL CYCLE OPTIMIZATION: Trailing P2 by 4 VP (108 vs 112), every decision must maximize competitive advantage. Strategy: spend 6 VP on cheap 1-VP upgrades to maximize influence pool across the 7-turn final cycle. This yields +15 extra influence cubes total - far exceeding the 6 VP cost in territorial control potential. Two agents (Blackbeard, Vane) reach Level 3 for promotion eligibility, advancing the 8/14 courtier victory path. Avoided expensive 4-VP upgrades as the VP cost outweighs marginal benefit in final cycle. Captain Varro already maxed at L3 with 4 upgrades. Post-upgrade VP: 102 (10 behind P2's 112). The 15 extra cubes must translate to 10+ VP through superior district control to overcome the deficit. Mathematical trajectory: influence superiority enables territorial dominance which generates the VP needed to close the gap."
